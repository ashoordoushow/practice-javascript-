***BEFORE CODING ALWAYS UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION BEING ASKED, AND TERMONILOGIES BEING USED!!!
***ALSO ONCE COMPLETED A PIECE OF CODE / QUESTION / SOLUTION - YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO DECRIBE, EXPLAIN, UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING THAT IS HAPPENING AND WHY, & EXPLAIN IT IN ENGLISH TERMS, AND ALSO BE ABLE TO DO IT FROM SCRATCH WITH NO EXTERNAL HELP/RESOURCES***

JavaScript Deliberate Practice Notes:
HTML = describes structure, the stage
JavaScript = executes logic, the actor

JavaScript cannot be written outside the <script> tag for Ex. <h1>let x = 2</h1> all logic should be written inside the <scipt> tags,
in html you can trigger javascript functions for Ex. <button onclick="doSomthing()">Click</button> (this is mainly for triggering functions, small interactions)

inside here:
<script>
This is where:

variables

functions

logic

calculations

console.log

document.write

etc.

This is real JavaScript code execution.
</script>

When you use backticks ``  <-- these are called template literals and are used for string interpolation ${text in here} <-- string interpolation allows you to display content together without concatentation (adding the + sign).

interpolation(embeds) = combining(embidding - correct term/avoids confusion with math) values together, building one string, values are being held in placeholders - ${}
concatentation(joins) = still building one string, + operator used to - join strings together (can get messy and harder to read)

***NOTE TO SELF/ TO DO AFTER COMPLETED A COUPLE JAVASCRIPT DP QUESTIONS: (currently using internal javascript - beginner friendly)
The professional rule you’ll hear later

In real projects, devs often:

put scripts in the head with defer

or put scripts at the bottom of the body

Both solve timing issues.

But you do not need to worry about that yet.
